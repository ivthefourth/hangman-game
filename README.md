## About
Classic single-player hangman game with an ASCII art interface. *Only works with keyboard input.*

### How to Play
Once home screen is loaded, press any key to start a new game. Then you can press a letter key to guess that letter. The interface will update to show whether you've guessed correctly or not. Continue guessing letters until you either win or lose. When the game is over, you can press the **'y'** key to play a new word and continue tracking wins and losses, or you can press the **'n'** key to reset and return to the home screen.
